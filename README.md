# My First C Codes
These are the first coding assignments I did in my 1st year in Istanbul Technical University CE, in 2015. All of them are written in C and are self-explanatory, you can just compile and run them. I won't explain the DNA searcher, you can enter random strings and try to guess what it does, it's fun to play with :)
